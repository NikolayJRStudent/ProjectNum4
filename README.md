Assignment: we have a MySQL relational database with a schema (country-city, language by country). And there is a frequent request from the city that is slowing down. We came up with a solution - to move all the data that is requested frequently into Redis (in memory storage of key-value type).

And we need not all the data stored in MySQL, but only a selected set of fields. The project will be in the form of a tutorial.
